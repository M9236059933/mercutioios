        "description": "Despite competition from Italy, Germany, and in-country rivals Rolls-Royce, the fastest, most luxurious SUV in the world still comes from only one place — Crewe, County Cheshire, England. Bentley has unveiled the 2021 Bentayga Speed, packing the previous Bentayga Speed's turbocharged W12 in the heavily revised styling, making for a stunning combination of looks and performance. While the W12 is unchanged, its 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque are enough to push the Bentayga from 0-62 MPH in 3.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 190 MPH. Inside the cabin, however, it's entirely possible one might not notice the velocity. Swathed in Alcantara or leather at the customer's choice, the Bentayga Speed combines the modern and traditional with a configurable digital dash and handcrafted opulence. The Bentayga Speed will also be available in a Black Edition, with the SUV arriving in dealers in early 2021.",
